The world is going through rapid
advancements in communication
technologies and with it, we are getting
faster and faster internet each passing year.
All of us, including the doctors, are
surrounded by smartphones and
computers. Remote Medical care is a field
that is emerging rapidly in this
background. Results are transmitted to the
Remote Medical Care centre, where they
are automatically analyzed. If any
abnormalities are detected, medical staff
contacts the patient and calls an ambulance
in the event of an emergency. In this paper
we design an app for college students who
often miss their regular health assessments
and avoid going to doctors for various
reasons. This app provides an interface for
both the doctors and the students to
interact and also digitizes the health report
of the student/user. The student, when in need, can enter his symptoms in the
interface provided to him which would be
the HelloDoctor app. Each time a student
submits the symptoms, the doctor gets
notified. The doctor responds and
prescribes medication to the student based
on his/her medical history through a web
app using his login credentials.
efficiency of the health center and also will
have a positive influence on the student
body.
